## 📊 Demo Notebook

To illustrate the machine learning workflow described in our publication, this repository includes a **demonstration notebook** built on a synthetic dataset.  

The notebook shows:
- Feature preparation (m/z ratios, ion types, lipid classes)  
- Regression modelling using Random Forest (scikit-learn)  
- Model evaluation with RMSE and R²  
- Visualisation of predicted vs actual retention times

> ⚠️ Note: The dataset used here is **synthetic and simplified**. It is a mock data. It is designed to demonstrate the concepts and pipeline rather than reproduce the original research results. The real sphingolipid datasets are not publicly available.

The following figures are adapted from the publication  
[ReTimeML: a retention time predictor that supports the LC–MS/MS analysis of sphingolipids](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-53860-0/figures/4).
